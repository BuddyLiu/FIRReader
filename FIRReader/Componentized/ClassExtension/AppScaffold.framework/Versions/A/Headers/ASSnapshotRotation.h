/**
 * An object designed to easily implement snapshot rotation.
 *
 * Snapshot rotation involves taking two screenshots of a UIView: the "before" and the "after"
 * state of the rotation. These two images are then cross-faded during the rotation, creating an
 * animation that minimizes visual artifacts that would otherwise be noticed when rotation occurs.
 *
 * This feature will only function on iOS 6.0 and higher. On older iOS versions the view will rotate
 * just as it always has.
 *
 * This functionality has been adopted from WWDC 2012 session 240 "Polishing Your Interface
 * Rotations".
